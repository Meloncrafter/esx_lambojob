I made my first Job. It´s an Lamborghini Racing job made for the Nordschleife

It´s the main code from the police job and the job menu from the mechanic Job, it´s currently set up with an lamborghini but you can change that.

Installation:
Drag and Drop the job folder in your ressource folder
then take the 2 folders in dependecies und drop them in your ressource folder 
after that add 
start esx_lambojob
start huracangt3evo
start NurburgringNordschleife
to your server.cfg
import the esx_lambojob.sql in your database and finish

NOTE:
if you are not using the nurnburgring you need to change the coords
and the status doesn´t update so you can park unlimited cars out
